# agriMicroX
A smart, automated microgreens cultivation system built using Arduino and IoT sensors to monitor and control environmental conditions for efficient, commercial-grade microgreens production.
This project demonstrates real-world smart agriculture using embedded systems, automation, and IoT-based sensing.\

Tools & Technologies:
ESP32
DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
Soil Moisture Sensor
SMPS (Power Supply)
Potentiometer
16x2 LCD Display
Water Pump + Nozzle.

Working:
Read temperature & humidity via DHT11
Read soil moisture level
Display values on LCD
If soil moisture < threshold → pump ON
If moisture restored → pump OFF
Continuous monitoring in real-time

Applications
Commercial microgreens production
Smart farming / hydroponics
Urban agriculture
IoT-based crop monitoring
Precision agriculture research
